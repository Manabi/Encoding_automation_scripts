==========

The script does the following:
- Checks if an index file is present / Indexes if not
- Checks if the files need to be encoded / Encodes them if they're missing
- Checks if the files need to be muxed / Muxes them if no muxed files are present
- Fetches the show name from parent dir for the muxing
- Automatically numbers/names the files correctly (NCED 1/Special 3 etc.)

A specific folder structure is necessary. You can get a template from [here](https://db.tt/TmWeTOYD).
